Though fierce in combat, their loyalty to their clan has earned deep respect. Cunning and resourceful, they often lead raids with careful planning. Their fearlessness and willingness to take risks have led them on countless daring escapades, making them a legend among their kin.",

    Traits: fierce, loyal, cunning  
    Traits: brave, wise, solitary  
    Backstory: Raised in the windswept highlands of Mak'Dur, this Orc has trained alone seeking enlightenment for decades. Their wisdom is sought by many, but few are brave enough to approach. With a rugged appearance and scars that tell tales of countless battles won, this Orc is constantly on guard, anticipating any potential threats. 
    Traits: chaotic, generous, beautiful
    Backstory: This Orc is a chaotic being, known for their unpredictable nature and spontaneous actions. Despite their fierce appearance, they possess a heart of generosity, always willing to help those in need, even if it goes against the typical Orc mentality. Their beauty is unconventional, with sharp features and a wild, untamed aura that sets them apart from others in their tribe.
    
    The stats (str,dex,con,int,wis,cha) must be assigned randomised values from this array: [15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8]
